source code of freshfromfarm website - 

  Static hosting is available at https://freshfromfarm.netlify.com/ , we are working on hosting the site with a server.

If you want to use this - 
  Download all the files and create separate folders for images, css, js files named 'images', 'css', 'js' respectively.
Keep rest of the files in the root folder. save this into your apache folder and enter localhost/'root-folder-name' and 
the index page should be displayed.

  The database is on the cloud so website is functional. Interact with the interface, SignUp, LogIn buy stuff and give me feedbackso I can make changes accordingly.
Thank You!.
