source code of freshfromfarm website

If you want to use this - 
  Download all the files and create separate folders for images, css, js files named 'images', 'css', 'js' respectively.
Keep rest of the files in the root folder. save this into your apache folder and enter localhost/'root-folder-name' and 
the index page should be displayed.

The database is not on the cloud yet so website wont be functional, but you can see the interface and give me feedback
so I can mae changes accordingly.
Thank You!.
